# WED Project: Hanoi Noibai Intl (VVNB)

Goal of this project is a redesign of the Hanoi Noibai International Airport (ICAO: VVNB).

The original FlightGear scenery has a few issues (e.g. overlapping runways) so I took this airport
as my first FlightGear Scenery project.

## Airport data

I create the airport using the World-Editor (WED), which is the standard X-Plane tool for airport layouting. 
I don't have any official data about the Noibai airport, so my work is based on some airport charts 
and Google Maps images.

## Further processing

The airport data cannot be used by flightgear directly. It needs to be compiled into scenery by using the
TerraGear tool suite. This is done in the project [VVNB_Hanoi_Noibai_Scenery][vvnb-scenery].
